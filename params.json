{"name":"Text Similarity Measurement using Convolutional Neural Networks","tagline":"","body":"This is a tool based on convolutional neural networks for text similarity measurement.\r\n\r\nThere could be rapid code changes, since we are still working on codes integration and cleanup right now, \r\n\r\nDependencies:\r\n1. The code requires the Torch deep learning library. Please install it first. We also requires 'nngraph' package and 'lfs' package.\r\n2. This requires Standford's Glove word embeddings. Please download this word embeddings (we will provide scripts for this)\r\n\r\nThis repository already comes with SICK data and MSRVID data.\r\n\r\nThen, simply type:\r\n``th trainSIC.lua'' to get our convolutional neural network model trained on the SICK data set.\r\n\r\nMore instructions/code updates to be coming. You can check back this page later.\r\n\r\nThanks.","google":"UA-59725909-2","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
