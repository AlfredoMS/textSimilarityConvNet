{"name":"Text Similarity Measurement using Convolutional Neural Networks","tagline":"","body":"Text Similarity Measurement using Convolutional Neural Networks\r\n\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\n------------\r\n\r\nThis tool can be used to measure semantic similarity given any two pieces of texts. \r\n\r\nThis repo contains the implementation of a convolutional neural network based model for comparing two sentences. Our model does not require external resources such as WordNet or parsers, and can still achieve highly competitive performance as measured on 3 public datasets (SICK, MSRVID, and MSRP).\r\n\r\nFor more details, please refer to our recent paper:\r\n- ``Multi-Perspective Sentence Similarity Modeling with Convolutional Neural Networks``\r\n- Hua He, Kevin Gimpel, and Jimmy Lin. Proceedings of the 2015 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP 2015).\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation and Dependencies\r\n------------\r\n\r\n- Please install Torch deep learning library. We recommend this local installation which includes all required packages our tool needs, simply follow the instructions here:\r\nhttps://github.com/torch/distro\r\n\r\n- Currently our tool only runs on CPUs, therefore it is recommended to use INTEL MKL library (or at least OpenBLAS lib) so Torch can run much faster on CPUs. \r\n\r\n- Our tool then requires Glove embeddings by Stanford. Please run fetech_and_preprocess.sh for downloading and preprocessing this data set (around 3 GBs).\r\n\r\n\r\nRunning\r\n------------\r\n\r\n- Command to run (training, tuning and testing all included): \r\n- ``th trainSIC.lua`` or ``th trainMSRVID.lua``\r\n\r\nThe tool will output pearson scores and also write the predicted similarity scores given each pair of sentences from test data into predictions directory.\r\n\r\n\r\nAckowledgement\r\n-------------\r\nWe thank Kai Sheng Tai for providing the preprocessing codes. We also thank the public data providers and Torch developers. Thanks.\r\n","google":"UA-59725909-2","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
